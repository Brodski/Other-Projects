SEVEN BENEFITS OF AWS 
1 Cost-effective
    On-demand pricing or Pay-as-you-go (PAYG) 
    thousands of customers sharing the cost of the resources
2 Global
    Launch anywhere in the world
3 Secure
    And you have the ability to configure access down to a granular level
4 Reliable
    Data backup, disaster recovery, data replication, and fault tolerance
5 Scalable
    Increase or decrease resources and services based on demand
6 Elastic
    Automate scaling during spikes and drop in demand
7 Current
    The underlying hardware and software is patched without interruption to you.

rnd facts
    not all servicers are in all region
    each region has generally 3 availablity zones
    us-east-1 has billing
    us-east-1 is the OG
    costs vary per region

4 factors to consider when choosing zone
    1 regulatroy compliance (what requried)
    2 costs
    3 services availablity
    4 latency
flag = region

Availability Zone (AZ) 
- a physical location made up of one or more datacenter.
- Each region consists of multiple Availability Zones, which are physically separated but connected
    - separated within a region, often miles apart, to minimize the impact of disasters eg fires, quakes ect.
    - An AZ will be 1+ datacenters
- usually 3 AZs per region, or more
    ex)
    "us-east-2a"
    "us-east-2b"
    "us-east-2c"
- subnets are associated with an AZ
- you dont choose an AZ with launching resources (via a dropdown UI)
    - INSTEAD  you choose the subnet, which is associated to the AZ
    
fault domain: 
    - a section of a network that is vulnerable to damage if a critical device or system fails. 
    - purpose: if a failur occurs it will not cascade outside that domain, limiting the damage 
    - could be:
        - a rack
        - an entire room in datacetner
        - the entire building
fault level 
    a collection of fault domains.
    - Fault Level: An AWS Region 
        - us-east-1 (Region)
    - Fault Domain: An Availability Zone 
        - us-east-1a (AZ)

NETWORKING

Cloud-Native Networking Services
    Region: geographical location of your network. Has multi AZs
    AZ: the data center of your AWS resources
    VPC: a virtual network dedicated to your AWS account
        - providing a isolated network environments where you can launch AWS resources.
    Subnets: a logical partition of an IP network into multiple, smaller network segments. public or private
    Internet Gateway: Enable access to the Internet
        - allows communication between instances in your VPC and the internet.
    Security Groups: Acts as firewall at the instance level
        - controlling inbound and outbound traffic. They define rules based on protocols, ports, and IP ranges
    NACLs: Acts as a firewalls at the subnet level
            - monitors inbound and outbound
    Route Tables: determines the routing of traffic within a VPC. 
        - contains rules (routes) for outbound/inbound traffic between subnets, internet gateways, and other network interfaces


    NACLs	                        Security Groups
-apply to subnets	            -apply to individual instances
-stateless	                    -stateful
-evaluate rules in order	    -evaluate all rules
-Allow & Deny rules	            -only Allow 
-can block single IPs	        -cannot block single IPs
    
Stateful:
    each request is aware of previous interactions. 
    Return traffic is automatically allowed if it matches an outgoing request
        Connection Tracking: Security groups are stateful, meaning they 
            automatically track the state of a connection. If you allow 
            an inbound request from a particular IP and port, the 
            corresponding outbound response is automatically allowed.
        Simplified Rules: You don't need to write separate rules for outbound 
            traffic responses. Once an inbound rule is established, the outbound rule is implied.
Stateless:
    each request is independent and not aware of prior requests. 
    Each packet is individually evaluated without context.

    Identity-Centric does not replace but augments Network-Centric Security
    
    
Zero Trust on AWS
    - Identity Security Contorls: lets you try to implement Zero Trust on AWS
    - assumes no implicit trust in any user, device, or system
        - no trust whether inside or outside the organization's network. 
    - Instead, it requires continuous verification of every access request 
        - enforces strict access controls to protect resources.  
    - AWS doesnt not ACTUALLY have 100% zero trust model
    IAM

    - is an open standard for authorization, 
    - enabling third-party applications to access user data without exposing passwords. 
    - allows users to grant limited access to their resources on one site (the resource server) to another (the client)
    - uses tokens. 
    - OAuth 2.0, the most widely used version, 
        - Google, Facebook, and Twitter.
    - is a protocol

SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language): 
    - is an open standard for exchanging auth data between IdP and a service provider 
    - XML-based 
    - Enables Single Sign-On (SSO)
        - enterprise environments 
    - is a protocol

    OpenID: 
        URL-based, simple
        consumer authentication.
            - Social logins (Google Facebook)
        log into multiple sites using a single set of credentials
    SAML: 
        XML, complex
        Enterprise
        SSO

Federated ID vs OpenID:
    FedID: 
        Broader identity management concept.
        Using corporate credentials to access external SaaS applications like Salesforce.
            - SAML, OAuth, and OpenID Connect.
        Enables Single Sign-On (SSO)

         over an IP network. 
    - provides a method for querying and modifying directory services,
        - directory service stores information about users, groups, devices, and other resources
    - Commonly used for storing user credentials (username/pass) and metadata
    - hierarchical structure 
    - enables SSO
    - some SSO uses LDAP, but nLDAP was not built for web apps
    - some systems only support LDAP and not SSO

            - Identities with a set of permissions that are assumed by users or services.
            - roles do NOT have long-term credentials
            - temporary credentials
            - grant AWS resources permissions to specific AWS API actions
            - Enhances security
            - Associate policies to a Role and then assign it to an AWS resource
            
            
IAM Anatormy:
    - json permissiosn which determin what API actions are allowed/denied
Version: 2012-10-17 is the latest version.
Statement: array of policies
    Sid (optional): a way of labeling your statements.
    Effect: Allow or Deny
    Action: list of actions that the policy allows or denies
    Principal: the account, user, role, or federated user you're applying the policy to
    Resource: an ARN-ish, the resource to which the action(s) applies
    Condition (optional): circumstances when the policy grants permission
    
    
Note:
    "Principal" is requried for Resource-Based policies
    Principal is required for Trust policies
    - Resource-Based policies:
        - Required when policies are directly attached to AWS resources 
            (e.g., S3 bucket policies, SNS topic policies, SQS queue policies).   
    - Trust policies:
        - Policies associated with IAM roles to define who can assume the role.
    ....
        # resource-based
          "Principal": {
            "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/Alice"
          },
        # Trust
        "Principal": {
            "Service": "ec2.amazonaws.com"
        },
  
  
    Principal is Not used for IAM Policies attached to IAM users, groups, or roles.
        - The Principal element is not needed because the policy is implicitly applied to the principal (user, group, or role) it is attached to.
        
        
        
        
        
Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP) 
    - is the computer security concept of providing a user,
        role, or application the least amount of permissions to perform a action.

Just-Enough-Access (JEA)
    Permitting only the exact actions for the identity to perform a task

Just-In-Time (JIT)
    Permitting the smallest length of duration an identity can use permissions

Risk-based adaptive policies
    - Each attempt to access a resource generates a risk score 
    - the risk score calcs how likely the request is to be from a compromised source.
    - calcs via: e.g. device, user location, IP address what service is being accessed and when

AWS does not have Risk-based  built into IAM



AWS Account Root User
    - Can run Administrative Tasks:
        !! Change your account settings.
            . account name, email address, root user password, and root user access keys.

    - manage access centrally across your AWS organization.
    
    
Application Integration
    - two independent applications communicate 
    - commonly facilitated by an intermediate system.

    - Cloud workloads encourage loosely coupled system 
    - thus AWS has many service for application integration.

    The common systems or design patterns utilized for
    Application Integration generally are:
    · Queueing
    . Streaming
    · Pub/Sub
    . API Gateways
    . State Machine
    . Event Bus
    
Messaging System:
    - decouple processes via messages / events
    - sender and receiver ( producer and consumer)

Queueing System:
    - deletes messages once they are consumed.
    - Simple communication
    - Not Real-time
    - Have to pull

AWS Simple Queueing Service (SQS):
    - enables decoupling and scaling of:
        - microservices
        - distributed systems
        - serverless application
    - sends, store, and receive messages between software components
    - SQS supports standard queues (offering at-least-once delivery and best-effort ordering) and FIFO queues
    - not real time
    
    
AWS Kinesis:
    - for real-time data streaming and processing. 
    - in real-time: collect, process, and analyze large streams of data records
    - react quickly to new information. 
    - Kinesis offers:

Publish-subscribe:
    - 1 Publishser instead send their messages to an event bus.
    - 2 Event Bus categorizes their messages into groups.
    - 3 When new messages are immediately delivered to subscribers.
    - app subscribes to these groups, at some point.
    - publishers do not send their messages directly to subscribers.
    - pattern commonly implemented in messaging systems.
    
Publisher ->           -> Subscriber 
Publisher -> Event Bus -> Subscriber 
Publisher ->           -> Subscriber 


. Publisher have no knowledge of who their subscribers are.
. Subscribers do not pull for messages.
. Messages are instead automatically and immediately pushed to subscribers.
· Messages and events are interchangeable terms in pub/sub


AWS Simple Notification Service (SNS):
    - a messaging service that sends notifications from applications to subscribers
    - supports multiple communication protocols, including email, SMS, HTTP/HTTPS, and AWS Lambda. 
    - for event-driven architectures. 
    - SNS allows you to decouple and scale microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications 
    - used for application alerts, sending notifications to end-users, and integrating with other AWS services for automated workflows.
    
    
API Gateway
    An API Gateway is a program that sits between a single-entry point and multiple backends.
    API Gateway allows for throttling, logging, routing logic or formatting of the request and response

AWS API Gateway:
    - creating secure APls
    - acts as a front door for applications for backend services such as:
        - AWS Lambda, EC2, or other web services.
    - handles all the tasks involved in accepting and processing up 100,000 of concurrent API calls
    - does:
        - including traffic management, 
        - authorization and access control, 
        - monitoring
        - API version management.
Mobile App
API Gateway Cache
Web App
HTTP/S
loT Device

State Machine:
    - each state represents a specific condition or situation, 
    - transitions define how the system moves from one state to another. 
    - In software engineering, state machines help manage complex workflows 
    - ensuring predictable state transitions. 
    - AWS Step Functions, for example, use state machines to coordinate the components 
    of distributed applications and microservices through visual workflows.
    
    
AWS Step Functions
    . Coordinate multiple AWS Services into a serverless workflow
    . A graphical console to visualize the components of your application as a series of steps
    . manage the execution and state of each step ensuring: 
        error handling, retries, and parallel processing 
    . easier to build, scale, and maintain apps 
    . use cases: ETL jobs, data processing pipelines, and microservice orchestration.

Event Bus:
    - An event bus receives events from a source and routes events to a target based on rules
    - a central communication system for apps to exchange information via events. 
    - It operates on the publish/subscribe (pub/sub) model, where:
        Producers: publish events to the event bus.
        Event Bus: Acts as an intermediary that receives events from producers and routes them to interested consumers.
        Consumers: Subscribe to Topics annd receive events from the event bus.
        
AWS EventBridge:
    - serverless event bus service by sttreamign real-time data to your app
    - a event bus service 
    - routes events from: AWS services and custom applications, 
    - routes events to: AWS Lambda, SQS, and more. 
    Event Bus
        Holds event data, define rules on an event bus to react to events.
        Default Event Bus - An AWS account has a default event bus
        Custom Event Bus - Scoped to multiple accounts or other AWS accounts
        SaaS Event Bus - Scoped to with Third party SaaS Providers
    Rules
        Determines what events to capture and pass to targets. (100 Rules per bus)
    Producers   
        AWS Services that emit events
    Targets
        AWS Services that consume events (5 targets per rule)
    Events
        Data emitted by services. JSON objects that travel (stream) within the event bus.
    Partner Sources
        Are third-party apps that can emit events to an event bus
        
SNS vs SQS vs EventBridge
    AWS SNS: 
        - for simple pub/sub messaging and notifications. 
        - It pushes messages to subscribers immediately.
    AWS SQS: 
        - for microservices, decoupling components
    AWS EventBridge: 
        - for complex event-driven architectures, 
        - sophisticated routing and filtering capabilities

    AWS SQS: 
        - Pull (from queue)
    AWS EventBridge: 
        - Push (via event bus)
        
Service Integration:
    SNS: targets Lambda, SQS, HTTP/S endpoints, SMS, Mobile Push, email, Data Firehose
    SQS: Any compute service can read from SQS (pull model). Lambda has direct integration.
    EventBridge: 
        - targets 30 AWS services: Lambda, SQS, SNS, Kinesis Streams, Firehose, Gateway, Step Function etc. 
            (Full list - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-targets.html)
        - targets third party pre-defined event integration: DataDog, Epsagon, New Relic,Salesforce, Zendesk etc.

Message Order:        
    SNS: FIFO maintains order
    SQS: FIFO queue maintains order
    EventBridge: Message order not maintained    
        
Scaling/Concurrency Controls:
    SNS: 
        - automatically scales, Nearly unlimited scaling.
        - tip, use Lambda per function concurrency setting to control downstream consumption. 
    SQS: 
        - automatically scales, 
        - Standard queue throughput is nearly unlimited.
        - tip, use Lambda trigger 
        - (Detailed read: https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/introducing-maximum-concurrency-of-aws-lambda-functions-when-using-amazon-sqs-as-an-event-source/
    EventBridge:
        - automatically scales up to 100K TPS (100,000 Transactions Per Second) PutEvents 
        - 18.5K TPS target invocations requests per second (can be increased, varies by region). 
        - tip, use Lambda 
        
Conditional Message Processing:
SNS:
    - can use SNS message filtering
        - invoke different subscriber based on values on message metadata and message content

SQS: 
    - can't decide consumer based on message. (Use SNS message filtering with SQS to achieve this)

EventBridge:
    - can route messages to targets based on message. (Event filtering)
    - Detailed rule based message filtering. 
        - schema registry

    EventBridge: Can transform messages before sending to target.


NOTE!
DLQ (Dead Letter Queue)
    - store messages that cannot be processed successfully
    - prevents failed messages from blocking the processing 
    - DLQs improve system resilience and reliability by isolating problematic messages and ensuring the main queue remains functional.
    - Dead-letter queues are useful for debugging your application 
        - b/c you can isolate unconsumed messages 
        
Retry/failure handling:
SNS:
    - retries a lot
    - If Lambda is not available, SNS will retry 2 times at 1 seconds apart, then 10 times
    exponentially backing off from 1 seconds to 20 minutes and finally 38 times every 20
    minutes for a total 50 attempts over more than 23 days before the message is discarded.
    - Use with SQS for DLQ. you have to configure SNS to put in DLQ via SQS
    
SQS:
    - Messages remain in the queue until deleted. They are prevented by being accessed by
    other consumers during the "visibility timeout". Successful Lambda invocations will cause
    deletions of messages automatically. If an invocation fails or doesn't delete a message
    during the visibility timeout, it becomes available for other consumers. DLQ can be used.
EventBridge:
    - If Lambda or other target service is not available, EventBridge will automatically retry
    delivery with backoff up to 24 hours before message is discarded from EventBridge. As
    soon as successful message delivery to target occurs, message is discarded. 
    - Use with SQS for DLQ

Application Integration:

    AWS SNS: 
        - a pub-sub messaging system. 
        - Sends notifications via various formats such as Plain-text Email, HTTP/s (webhooks) SMS (text messages), SQS and Lambda. 
        - Push messages which then are sent to subscribers

    AWS SQS: 
        - a queueing messaging service.

Capital vs Operational Expenditure


Capital Expenditure (CAPEX)

    Spending money upfront on physical infrastructure Deducting that expense from your tax bill over time.

    · Server Costs (computers)
    · Storage Costs (hard drives)
    . Network Costs (Routers, Cables, Switches)
    . Backup and Archive Costs
    . Disaster Recovery Costs
    . Datacenter Costs (Rent, Cooling, Physical Security)
    . Technical Personal
    - Also: pyshical security, hardware, IT personal, maintaince
    
    With Capital Expenses you have to guess upfront what you plan to spend    
    
Operational Expenditure (OPEX)

    The costs associated with an on-premises datacenter that    
        has shifted the cost to the service provider. The customer
        only has to be concerned with non-physical costs.
    
    . Leasing Software and Customizing features
    . Training Employees in Cloud Services
    . Paying for Cloud Support
    . Billing based on cloud metrics eg.
    . compute usage
    . storage usage

    With Operation Expenses you can try a product or service without investing in equipment
    
    
Total Cost of Ownership? (TCO)?
    - a financial estimate intended to help buyers determine the costs of a product.
    - getting TCO is useful when your company is looking to migrate from on-premise to cloud.
    
    
Does cloud make IT Personnel redundant?

    Shifting your IT Team
    . A company needs IT personnel during the migration phase
    · A company can transition some roles to new cloud roles:
    . Networking to Cloud Networking
    . A company may decide to take a Hybrid approach so they'll always need to have a traditional IT
    team and a Cloud IT Team
    . A company can change employees activities from Managing Infrastructure to Revenue Generating
