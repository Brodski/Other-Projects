Element: System
	eg) System.out.println("Hello, World!");
	- This denotes that the subsequent expression will call upon the System class, from the 
java.lang package.

java.lang package
	- Auto imported into every java program
	- contains classes and interfaces that are essential to the Java language.
	- primative types (boolean, int, float, byte, ect), and System, string, Thread


Element: (dot operator) .
eg) obj.toString(); 
	-Dot operators provide you access to a classes members; i.e. its fields
(variables) and its methods. 
	-'obj' is dereferenced. 
	-Dereferencing follows the memory address stored in a reference, to the place in memory where the 
actual object resides. 

Field  
	is a variable inside a class. 

Members 
	Variables, Methods, Inner class, or (the super class's constructor)
	
Literal:
	-A variable is a name that can represent different values during the execution of the program. 
	-A constant is a name that represents the same value throughout a program. 
	-But a literal is not a name -- it is the value itself.
	-A literal can be a number, a character, or a string. For example, in the expression,
		x = 3     x is a variable, and 3 is a literal.

bytecode:
	Bytecode is program code that has been compiled from source code into low-level code designed for a 
software interpreter. It may be executed by a virtual machine (such as a JVM) or further compiled into 
machine code, which is recognized by the processor.
	bytecode is compiled programming code that targets a virtual machine rather than a specific 
computer architecture
	- if compiled into bytecode, then its a comiopled language (java, C)
	- if interpreted, then executing a program means reading the source file a line at a time, and doing 
what it says
	- interpreted is where the instructions are not directly executed by the target machine, but instead read and executed 
by some other program 

JVM:
	- Java Virtual Machine
	- A JVM is a software-based machine that runs Java programs. 
	- reads (interprets?) the compiled code, (bytecode) 
	- JVMs allow Java apps to run on almost any computer. Windows, OS X, and Linux 
	- similar to a physical processor. 
	- the Java code  from a .JAVA file must first be converted into instructions the JVM can understand.
		 called "bytecode,"

int: 2^15 (-,+)
double: 2^31 -,+
float: 32 bits
double 64 bits
long double 128

- Javascript; Object based scripting (protype) language   
										| Java; OOP  language
- Javascript; Runs on a browser only.   | Java; Runs as an application, run on a virtual machine 
- Javascript; it is interpreted, not compiled. Every browser has a interpreter
										| Java; compiled and executed... machine code
- Javascript; event based 				| Java thread based 
- Javascript; DYNAMICALLY typed language | Java; STATICALLY typed language
- Javascript; Objects are PROTOYPE based | Java; Objects are class bassed, everything must be w/in a class
- Javascript easier to implement. 		 | Java faster, powerful
		https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-java-and-javascript/

Prototype objects
	- Javascript
	- When already-created objects are cloned and reused to construct a program.
	- It uses a classless inheritance programming style in creating duplicate object instances.
	- Prototype-based programming is also known as classless programming or instance-based programming.
		https://www.techopedia.com/definition/30040/prototype-based-programming
	- Polymorphism NO
	- Inheritance NO
	- Encapsualtioon Yes
		
Statically typed language:
	- Java
	- the data type of a variable is known at compile time
	- all variables must first be declared before they can be used. 
	- Once declared to be of a certain data type, it cannot hold values of other data types
	- advantage: lots of trival bugs are caught at early stages
Dynamically typed languages: 
	- Javascript, Ruby, Python
	- variable types can change at run time. 
	- you dont have to specify the data type of the variable before compile time
	- advantage: faster programming

	
Scripting Language
	-scripts: programs written for a special run-time environment that automate the execution of tasks
that could alternatively be executed by a human operator
	- are often interpreted (rather than compiled).
	- a programming language is typically compiled first before being allowed to run, 
	- scripting languages are interpreted from source code or bytecode one command at a time.
	-  is a computer language with a series of commands within a file that is capable of being executed 
without being compiled
----------------------------------------------------------

Value: 
	- contents 
	- a number that has value to the programer
	- the representation of some entity that can be manipulated by a program
	
Reference: 
	- address, location,   
	- a value that enables a program to access a particular datum, such as a variable's value
	
Primativate data type - 
	- They are the most basic kinds of data types and they driectly contain values. 
	- 8 total: int, float, double, long, shot, byte, char, boolean
Object data 
	- programmer created types
	
	
Data Type
	- itentifies what type of data that an object can hold and what operations can be applied to it

---------------------------------------------------

Lambda
	- A function with no name.
	- An expression whose value is a function
	- Don't need to: declare the function somewhere else (and look for it later).
	- Naming something that you're only using once.
	Ex) args.foreach(arg => println(arg))
	- the argument to the foreach method is an expression for an anonymous function. 
	- lambda = anonymous function

	
------------------------------------------------------

Subtyping
	- when a subclass object is used in place of it's superclass
	- Cat is a subtype of Animal, then Cat can be used wherever Animal is use
	
Enumerated
	- a set of named values
	- identifiers that behave as constants in the language.
	- implicitly public static final.
	
-------------------------------------
OOP
------------------------------------

Object Oriented Programing
	- organized around data. "data controlling acces to code"
	- in an OO langauge you define the data and the routines that are permitted to act on that data.
	
	- Purpose; To break large complex programs down into small simple pieces that work together
	- is the relationships and interactions between classes/objects, without specifying the final 
application classes/objects that are involved
	
	- Encapsualtioon
	- Polymorphism
	- Inheritance

Class
	-the blueprints/template for objcts, and describes the state/behavior
	-State: properties of an object
	-Behavior
	-  used to model real-world objects you find in life

Object
	- instance of a class
	- operates on its "own" data structure
	- exists in memory
	- could be multiple, but only 1 class to describe all of it's objects

------------------------------------------------------------

POLYMORPHISM 
	- the programming language's ability to process objects differently depending on 
their data type. 
	- IS-A test is considered to be polymorphic.
	- method overloading 
	- method overriding
	- subtyping
	- (when you access a object or type, the code determines which exact type it is and calls the associated 
code.)
	https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1031273/what-is-polymorphism-what-is-it-for-and-how-is-it-used

------------------------------------------------------------
ENCAPSULATION
	- a data-hiding mechanism that restricts access to the objects
	- It a mechanism of wrapping the variables and the methods that act on the data together as a single unit
		
	- Java's basic unit of encapsulation is the class. ... package 2nd example
	
	- Access Modifiers (public private) ... define the visibility of classes, methods, and attributes 
	- the variables of a class will be hidden from other classes, and can be accessed only 
through the methods of their current class. 
	Purpose: 
	- keeps code and data safe from outisde interferance and misuse.
	- prevents the data from being accessed from the outside
	- protect data
	- (flexible easier to change?)
	
--------------------------------------------------------------	
	
ABSTRACTION 
	- where you show only “relevant/essential” data and “hide” unnecessary details of an object from the user
	- "abstracting away the details"
	- making the programming simpler, reduce complexity.
	- generalizting, via abstract class & interface
	- Abstraction is about simplicity (removing & generalizing), Encapsualtioon is about security.
	
	- (providing only essential information about the data to the outside world, hiding the background 
details or implementation.)

---------------------------------------
																		
INHERITANCE	: IS-A		
																
	- where one class acquires the properties (methods and fields) of another.
	- Purpose: You can reuse the fields of another class
	
	- Cannot have multiple inheritacnes of classes (C# & Java) ... Diamond problems		 	 
	- Subclasses inherit: 
		- public members
		- protected
		- (private fields/methods are still accessible by methods and innter classes)
	- Subclasses DONT inherit:
		- private members 
		- Constructors
		- members with the same name as the Parent class
	- Members = Variables, Methods, Inner class, or (the super class's constructor)
	
	- Recall: When you create an object, that object will inherit fields from all of the class's 
superclasses.
	- methods or constructors of same field; problematic.
	- super class  = base class = parent class
	- subclass = derived class = extended class = child class
	- a super class is the parent class of a derived class
	
	-Subclass will have more methods and variables than super class
	-Subclass will inherit all the properties of the superclass except the 
private properties of the superclass
	- SubClass IS-A SuperClass
	
	Ex)
	public class Animal {}
	public class Mammal extends Animal {}				
	public class Dog extends Mammal {}
	- Animal is the superclass of Mammal Class ... Mammal IS A Animal
	- Mammal is the subclass of Animal						
	- Dog is the subclass of booth Mammal and Animal ... Dog IS A Mammal
	
	Ex)
public class mySuperClass {  }
public class subClass extends mySuperClass { }
public static void main(String(args[]){
	// The subclass will have at least all the properties of the superclass.
	// Thus this is possible
	mySuperClass superClassX = new subClass();
}
----------------------------
INTERFACE
	- The set of behaviours/controls on an object.
	- Typically, a company sells a software package that contains complex methods that another company 
wants to use in its own software product.

	- contains only the declaration of the members, no body 
	- Can contain: methods, properties, events, indexers (C#)
	- Can't contain: constants, fields, operators, instance constructors, finalizers, or types. No static
	
	- Could implement mutliple interfaces to a class
	- In Java, Static methods and Default methods could be used in an interface to define a methods body 
in the interface. The purpose, so you dont have to change the class that implements the interfaec
	- Interfaces contain no implementation of methods. 
	- classes that implement interfaces must implement all its members.
	- A class or struct can implement multiple interfaces. A class can inherit a base class and also 
implement one or more interfaces.

	List a = new ArrayList();
	List b = new LinkedList();
	List c = new Vector(); 
	List d = new Stack(); 
	- The list Interface is implemented by ArrayList, LinkedList, Vecor and Stack classes, and more

	public void setMapReference(int xCoordinate, int yCoordinate) { //method code }
	- setMapReference(int, int) is the method signature

---------------------------------------------------------									

IMMUTABLE
 - is an object whose state cannot be modified after it is created.
 - Contains:
 - class & data members are private final.
 - a constructor
 - Getters
 - No setters
 Immutable vs Final
 - By declaring a reference variable as final, we won’t get any immutability nature
 - final ensures that the address of the object remains the same whereas the Immutable suggests that we 
can’t change the state of the object once created.
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/final-vs-immutability-java/

SINGLETON
- a class that can have only one object of itself
- Contains: 
- private constructor (prevents instantiating the object )
- public variable/setters
- "getter" for the object (static  accessor method, ie, a factory method to return the class member)
- creates  static object of itself (private static mySingleton st = null;)

FINAL in Java (sealed in C#)
- "final" class 	to prevent inheritence, your class from being subclassed. 
- "final" methos 	to prevent overriding, prevent certain methods within your class from being overriden. 
- "final" variable	to create constants, prevent changes to a variable's value. A final variable can only be 
initialized once,


Instance Initialization Blocks 
	- executed before constructors. 
	- They are executed whenever the class is initialized and before constructors are invoked.
	- They are typically placed above the constructors within braces.
	https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/instance-initialization-block-iib-java/
 
 ---------------------------------------
 
Abstract class
	- for the sole purpose of making a class a subclass of another.
	- can only be subclassed
	- cannot be instantiated
	- (In C#, virtual means that a method could overriden)
	- (In C#, for each abstract method you must use the override keyword in the subclass that inherit the 
abstract  classes)

	- Abstract method is a method that is declared without an implementation 
	Ex)
abstract void moveTo(double deltaX, double deltaY);


----------------------------------------------------

	NOT (quite) OOP

----------------------------------------------------

GENERICS
	- Allows you to make "generic" methods or classes to whatever type
	- Allows types to be a parameter to methods, classes and interfaces.
	- generic method can be called with arguments of different types
	- can processes objects without stating what type the object is.
	
	- Code Reuse: can write a method/class/interface once and use for any type we want.
	- Type Safety: Generics make errors to appear at compile time than at run time
	Ex) public class Box<T> {...}
	
	Bounded Type Parameterized
	- accept types which extend/implement a class/interface, (Comparable)
	- ? = wildcard = any type
	- public static <T extends Comparable<T>> T maximum(T x, T y, T z) {  T max = x; ..... }
	- add(List<? extends Number> list) .... Upper Bounded Wildcards
	- add(List<? super Integer) .......... Lower Bounded Wildcard
	
	- Parameterized type - a class that deals with other objects without stating what type it is.
				     	 - types that take other types as parameters. 	


--------------------------------------------------------------


Access Modifiers:
	public 		- this class, other classes (w/in package), subclasses, packages, the entire app
	protected 	- this class, subclasses, packages
	(no modifer)- this class, package
	private 	- this class

Access Levels
Modifier	
			Class	Package	Subclass	Entire App
public		Y		Y		Y			Y
protected	Y		Y		Y			N
no modifier	Y		Y		N			N
private		Y		N		N			N

	- Protected: Variables, methods, and constructors, which are declared protected in a superclass can 
	be accessed only by the subclasses in other package or any class within the package of the 
protected members' class.

PACKAGE
	-  a namespace that organizes a set of related classes and interfaces.
	-  bundle of related types (classes, interfaces, enumerations, ect) 
	-  software written in the Java programming language can be composed of hundreds or thousands of 
individual classes, 
	- keep things organized by placing related classes and interfaces into packages.
	This allows you, the programmer, to focus on the design of your particular application, rather than the 
infrastructure required to make it work.

----------------------------------------------------

STATIC
	- A static variable will get memory only once and retain its value
		- all objects that have a static variable will have same value
	- A static method can be invoked without the need for creating an instance of a class.
	- A static method can access static data member and can change the value of it.	
	- It makes your program memory efficient (i.e., it saves memory).
	
	- in Java only static inner classes
	- in C#, a static class cannot be instantiated... Because there is no instance variable, you access the 
members of a static class by using the class name it

--------------------------------------------------------

STACK

	- new block (called stack frame) is created in the stack memory whenever a method is invoked
	- holds references to other objects in the heap
	- holds local primatives
	- when the foo() method terminates, the memory for the method foo() is freed

	Heap memory is used by all the parts of the application whereas stack memory is used only by one thread of execution.
	Stack memory is short-lived whereas heap memory lives from the start till the end of application execution.
	
	The run-time stack, consisting of stack frames, is responsible for program execution and function calls. 
	A stack frame contains all the data for one function call: its parameters, the return address, and its local variables. 

	The stack frame only exists during the execution time of a function, and so do the objects on the stack frame
	- stack frame a portion of memory allocated for a block of code, block of code = method?

	When you declare and instantiate an object. The actual object goes on the heap. What goes on the stack? The 
address of the object on the heap. C++ programmers would call this a pointer, but some Java developers are 
against the word "pointer". Whatever. Just know that the address of the object goes on the stack.
	
	
HEAP
	- holds all objects & its data
	- hold JRE classes

JRE (Java Runtime Environment )
	-provides the minimum requirements for executing a Java application; it consists of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), core classes, and 
supporting files.	
	


int    *ip;    /* pointer to an integer */
double *dp;    /* pointer to a double */
float  *fp;    /* pointer to a float */
char   *ch     /* pointer to a character */
-The actual data type of the value of all pointers, whether integer, float, character, or otherwise, is the 
same, a long hexadecimal number that represents a memory address. The only difference between pointers of 
different data types is the data type of the variable or constant that the pointer points to.


	
Shallow/Deep Copy
	-Deep: Any object pointed to by the source is copied and the copy is pointed to. 
	So two completely separate objects will be created.
	-Shallow: Copies references.
	A shallow copy constructs a new compound object and then (to the extent possible) inserts references into it to the objects found in 
the original.
	A deep copy constructs a new compound object and then, recursively, inserts copies into it of the objects found in the original.
	
	
String Pool:
	-The string pool allows string constants to be reused, which is possible because strings in Java are 
immutable.




--------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------

Design Patterns:
	- It is a template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different 
situations/application or systems 
	
MVC
	Model 	- Gets the data from the database or XML-file and processes it
			- responds to view and controller
	View	- UI, What the user sees
			- HTML/CSS
			- Templating engines
	Contoler- Takes user input 
			- Gets data from the model, passes data to the view
			- does calculations and processes data sent to it
			- logic
			
MVC

frameworks that uses MVC concpets
- Flask
- Ruby on Rails
- Angular JS

Model
- gets and sends data
- interacts with dataase (SQL or NOSQL or XML or JSON)
- manipulates data
- business logic
- communicat with controller
- sometimes can update the view (depends on framework

View
- The UI, what user see
- HTML/CSS
- Communicates with controller
- Template Engines

Controller
- Receives input (from view, clicking link, forms)
- contoler interaction between the model and view (user clicks, etc)
- Gets data from model
- passes data to the view
		

--------------------------------------------------------
REST
	-In the REST architectural style, the implementation of the client and the implementation of the server 
can be done independently without each knowing about the other. This means that the code on the client side 
can be changed at any time without affecting the operation of the server, and the code on the server side 
can be changed without affecting the operation of the client.
	- stateless : the server does not need to know anything about what state the client is in and vice versa.
	GET 	— return 200 (OK)
	POST 	— return 201 (OK CREATED)
	PUT 	— return 200 (OK)
	DELETE 	— return 204 (NO CONTENT) 
REST API
- the messenger that takes requests adn tells a system what you want and then returns the response.
- a piece of software that plugs one application directly into the data and services of 
another, granting it access to specific parts of a server. 


API
- APIs are the 'middle man', they can sit between your program and the hardware (or other software)
- helps two different layers (software/hardware) talk to each other w/o having tons of code in common.
- these software layers help standardize the programing process so program can interact with lots 
of others easily
-makes it possible for all the disparate devices and software work well with each other
- device layer
	- APIs are used for communication between services
	- APIs let two pieces of software communicate
	- EX) An API for a website is code that allows two software programs to communicate with each another
	- APIs also control access to resources
	- APIs are also used to control access to hardware devices and software functions that an application 
	may not necessarily have permission to use. 
	- APIs often play a big role in security.

Driver
	- software that allows your computer to communicate with hadware or devices. (sound card)
	- very low level?

Processes and Threads
	- Processes are often seen as synonymous with programs
	- Threads exist within a process — every process has at least one. 
	- Threads share the process's resources, including memory and open files. 





--------------------------------------------------------


- Firmware is software written directly into our hardware devices.
- Firmware is stored on flash ROM (special types of memory) 
	- written once, by the manufacturer 
-exmpale
	There's firmware in computer motherboards (it's called BIOS or UEFI), there's firmware in hard disks, solid-state drives (SSDs), 
CD/DVD/Blu-Ray drives, there's firmware in network cards, routers, access points, range extenders, there's even firmware in your 
gaming mouse and keyboard. These are just some examples that are related to computers.
firmware VS operating system
	firmware is stored on the hardware device itself while drivers are installed inside the operating system. Also, firmware can start 
on its own and do what it is programmed to do while drivers must be run by the operating system. The biggest difference between the 
two is that the firmware tells the devices what they should do, while the driver tells the operating system how to communicate with 
the same devices.
- provides the low-level control for the device's specific hardware. 
--------------------------------------------------------

CONTAINERS

	- It allow you to package your application together with libraries and other dependencies, providing 
isolated environments for running your software services.
	- Instead of virtualizing the hardware stack as with the virtual machines approach, containers 
virtualize at the operating system level, with multiple containers running atop the OS kernel directly. 
	- Containers virtualize the operating system instead of hardware. 
	- containers are far more lightweight: they share the OS kernel, start much faster, and use a fraction 
of the memory  
	create predictable environments that are isolated from other applications. 
	allow you to package your application and its dependencies together into one succinct manifest that can 
be version controlledI
	Containers can also include software dependencies needed by the application, such as specific versions 
of programming language runtimes and other software libraries.
less time debugging and diagnosing 


--------------------------------------------------------

 Agile
	- iterative development
	- flexible, adaptive planning
	- frequenlt delievery
	- feedback, communication
	- face to face

Waterfall
	- progress and project phases are linear
	- development steps be taken throughout the software development
	
	
SOFTWARE AS A SERVICE
	- rent 
	- software is purchased as a subscription
	- the software is hosted on the cloud; accessed by the customer via internet, no worries about OS like mac
	- SaaS uses the web to deliver applications that are managed by a third-party vendor and whose interface 
is accessed on the clients’ side. Most SaaS applications can be run directly from a web browser without any 
downloads or installations required, 
	low risk for customer
	
	allows many businesses to exercise better and more predictable budgeting.
	SaaS removes the need for organizations to install and run applications on their own computers or in their own data centers.


Software Cycle
	- is a process that produces software with the highest quality and lowest cost in the shortest time
	- Requirement gathering and analysis -Meetings with managers, stake holders and users are held in order 
to determine the requirements
	- Design - specifying hardware and system requirements and also helps in defining overall system 
architecture
	- Implementation - work is divided in modules/units and actual coding is started. 
	- Testing - unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing, non-functional testing 
	- Deployment 
	- Maintenance - problems comes up and needs to be solved
	
--------------------------------------------------------

Threads & Processes
	a process is a collection of virtual memory space, code, data, and system resources. a thread is code that is to be 
serially executed within a process. a processor executes threads, process always has at least one thread of execution, 
known as the primary thread

SDK (Software Development Kit)
	- a set of software development tools that allows the creation of applications for a certain software 
package, software framework, hardware platform, computer system, video game console, operating system, or 
similar development platform
	- ex) visual editors or debuggers, chat SDK, or image SDKs

Protocol
		A protocol is a set of rules and guidelines for communicating data. Rules are defined for each step 
and process during communication between two or more computers. Networks have to follow these rules to 
successfully transmit data.
	
--------------------------------------------------------
C# and C++


DEBUG AND Release
	- Debug and Release are just labels for different solution configurations.
	- Release mode optimizes 
	- Debug generates debug data, in.pdb (Program Database File) files 

PREPROCESSOR DIRECTIVE 
	#IF DIRECTIVE
	- compiless the code between the directives only if the specified symbol is defined
	- followed eventually by an #endif directive
	- eg) #if (DEBUG && !MYTEST)
	
STA Thread
- tells the compiler to use a Single Thread Apartment model
- If not present, the application uses the multithreaded apartment model, which is not supported for Windows Forms.
- used for Windows Forms (GUI's) as that uses Win32 for its drawing, which is implemented as STA. If you are using something that's STA model from multiple threads then you get corrupted objects
- don't worry about it, just accept that Windows GUI threads must be marked as STA otherwise weird stuff happens

Win32 = Window's (API) for developing 32-bit applications,  available in the Microsoft WIndows operating systems

LAZY
	- “Lazy Instantiation” defers creation of an object till the time it is actually accessed.
	- Lazy Instantiation optimizes resources by using them when it is actually required
	- The process of object creation is always expensive as it involves allocation of memory on the heap.
	- when object creation is non-trivial (taxing)

COM (Component Object Model)
	- COM is a mechanism that was developed (by Microsoft) to allow people to distribute binaries that could be reused even if the 
		caller was using another vendor's C++/C# compiler or (ultimately) a different language altogether.
	- The essence of COM is a language-neutral way of implementing objects that can be used in environments different from the one in 
		which they were created, even across machine boundaries
	- COM is a platform-independent, distributed, object-oriented system for creating binary software components that can interact	
		it defines a binary interoperability standard for creating reusable software libraries that interact at run time. 
		libraries without the requirement of compiling them into your application.
ASSEMBLY
	- In C# terms, it's basically a single C# project.
	- An assembly is the compiled output of your code, typically a DLL or EXE 
	- Assembly is the smallest unit of deployment of a .net application. It can be a dll or an exe.
	- Ttwo types: Private Assembly, Public/Shared Assembly, Satellite Assembly
		- Assemblies are the building blocks of .NET Framework applications; they form the fundamental unit of deployment, version 
control, reuse, activation scoping, and security permissions. An assembly is a collection of types and resources that are built to 
work together and form a logical unit of functionality.
	(Access modifiers article) .. All types and type members have an accessibility level, which controls whether they can be used from 
other code in your assembly or other assemblies
	https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2972732/what-are-net-assemblies
	https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/088ce8ed-ef9b-4dea-88b3-ca016885e26d/what-is-an-assembly-in-terms-of-c?forum=csharplanguage
	

BOXING
	- boxing and unboxing are computationally expensive processes.
	int i = 123;      // a value type
	object o = i;     // boxing
	int j = (int)o;   // unboxing

Struct Vs Class
		- struct: all members are public by default
		- class: all members are private by default
		- classes are reference types and structs are value types
		- structures do not support inheritance
		- structures cannot have default constructor
		- Purpose: The general rule to follow is that structs should be small, simple (one-level) 
collections of related properties, that are immutable once created; for anything else, use a class.

Single responsiblity principle
	- every class & method has a single responsiblty
	- makes it easy to quick and reason what each portion of the project is
	- if a class or method is doing too much and its hard to tell what it's doing
	
/etc
	system wide configurations
	not user specfic config
	
/boot
	system boot
	where your system starts
	
/dev
	device
	keyboards, mice, network?

/bin
	binaries
	ls, cd, chmod
	
/lib
	library
	librarys that apps could use to provide various function
	
/mnt
/mount
/media
	other mounted drives
	floppy disk, usb, network drive, external hd, (A: or B: drive in windows)
	
/opt
	optional
	where manually installed sw from venders resides
	
/proc
	psudeo files that contain info about system processes and resources
	# cat  /proc/cpuinfo
	# cat /proc/uptime
	
/root
	the root user's home folder
	unlike users home folder it rsides not in the default home file
	root always has access to its home directory in this area
	
/run
	it runs in RAM, so everything is gone when the system restarts

/sbin
	system bin
	
/snap
	snap packed (used by ubuntu)
	
/srv
	service directory for syervice data
	if you run a server like ftp then it has better security

/sys
	system
	a way to interact to the kernal
	could make changes to graphics card
	
/tmp
	temporary
	files are temp stored by application
	an app might write to temp requently in case the app crashes
	is usually emptied on system restart
	
/usr
	apps installed by the user
	non essential for basic system operations
	
/var
	variable
	files that are expected to grow
	/var/crash holds info about stuff that crashed
	/var/log contains log files about many system
	
/home
	each user has own folder
	store personal documents
	store personal app's configs

	DESIGN PATTERNS

https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/



FACTORY
	- related to object creation
	- we create object without exposing the creation logic to client 
	- uses a static member-function (static factory method) which creates & returns (newly created) objects
	- Advantage: provides "code for interface rather than implementation."
	ex)	 ShapeFactory shapeFactory = new ShapeFactory();
		 Shape shape1 = shapeFactory.getShape("CIRCLE");
		 Shape shape2 = shapeFactory.getShape("SQUARE");
MVVC 
	- Model-view-ViewModel
	- essential, the view does extra work on the data
	- the ViewModel of MVVC s a value converter, meaning it is responsible for converting the data objects 
from the model in such a way that objects are easily managed and presented. 
	- the ViewModel is more model than view, and handles most if not all of the 
view's display logic

OBSERVER PATTERN 
	- a software design pattern 
	- an object (the subject), maintains a list of its dependents, (the observers), and notifies them 
automatically of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods.
	-  in event driven software.
	https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/observer-pattern-set-2-implementation/

(LOOSE COUPLING)
	-  is an approach to interconnecting the components in a system so that those components, depend on each 
other to the least extent practicable.
	- hardware and software may interact but they are not dependant on each other to work
	-The goal of a loose coupling architecture is to reduce the risk that a change made within one element 
will create unanticipated changes within other elements.
	- (network, hardware, software, or other functional components)
	
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
NETWORKING

nifi is a data flow managment system that come with a web ui to handle data flows


flow based program: a series of nodes and edges that the data moves through.

connectors = edges
processes = nodes
data stored w/ in a package of info called a flow file, = content, attributes and age

Networking Devices: 
	Modem
	Hub
	Switch 
	Router
	Gateway
	
hubs & switches are used to create networks
	-hubs are older and worse, not used often
	- hub & switches use mac address)
	
routers are used to connect networks
	- routers use IP address, thus it can talk to outside world
	
Gateway: interconnects different networks


	
a modem is what brings the internet into your house
	b/c there are only 2 types of signals
A coputer only reads digital siganls
the internet only reads analog singals
	signals to your comp: the modem demodulates the analog singals into digital signals
	signals from your comp: the domem modules the digital signals into analog siganls.
		
	
NIC - Network Interface Card
	- the card that allows you to connect to the internet
	- manages network connection
	- fits into a slot in motherboard, or external port
	- often a cable (Cat5) connects NIC to another device OR a wireless thing built in computer
	- all comps have a NIC
	- NIC is connected to a hub/switch
	- routers direct traffic
	- the server uses high end connections to transmit data on internt

Peer 2 Peer - a singel cable between 2 computers (not common)	

networks usually require 3 pcies of hardware
	- Network card
	- cable
	- device to connect to 
	
switch 
WAN - Wide Area Network
	- a network over a lorge geographical area (corparations business in NY to LA)
		- Domain "Charter in NYC" to Domain "Charter in LA"
	- it connectes diffrent small networks(LANs)
		- so comps in one location can communicate w/ comps in ahtoer
		- building to building, town to town, city to city
		
NAT - Network Addres Translation
	- NAT Is used in routers
	- translate a set of IP addres to another set of IP address
	- helps preserve limited amount of IPv4 address
	
IPv4 - there are 2 types	
	- Public or Private
	- cannot access internet w/ private, your private is used internally/locally
	- your router gives your internal devices a private IP
	- public is publicly registered on internet, must have public IP to go on the internet
	- router will gives private IP address to your internal devies
	- the private IP will be tranaslted by NAT to public IP address
	- the public IP will be translated by NAT to private
	
	
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
	

LEFT JOIN
	SELECT Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderID
	FROM Customers
	LEFT JOIN Orders
	ON Customers.CustomerID=Orders.CustomerID
	
	- First, start from "FROM x LEFT JOIN y ON z=z2"
	- you'll get multiple rows with the same value of CustomerID, (w/ some differences in other fields)
	- this means "for each table, whenever there is a CustomerID value find the same CustomerID value in the other table
		if it exists in the right table, we have a match, so return all fields (or selected fields)
		if it exists or not in the left table return all fields
	- The LEFT JOIN keyword returns all records from the left table (Customers), even if there are no matches in the 
right table (Orders).

OUTER JOIN
	SELECT Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderID
	FROM Customers
	FULL OUTER JOIN Orders ON Customers.CustomerID=Orders.CustomerID
	
	- LEFT & RIGHT join, meaning you'll 
	- The FULL OUTER JOIN keyword returns all matching records from both tables whether the other table matches or not. 
So, if there are rows in "Customers" that do not have matches in "Orders", or if there are rows in "Orders" that do not 
have matches in "Customers", those rows will be listed as well.

SELF JOIN
	SELECT A.CustomerName AS CustomerName1, B.CustomerName AS CustomerName2, A.City
	FROM Customers A, Customers B
	WHERE A.CustomerID <> B.CustomerID
	AND A.City = B.City 
	
	
	-The following SQL statement matches customers that are from the same city:
	-A self JOIN is a regular join, but the table is joined with itself.
	-(Doesnt use JOIN)
	
UNION
	The UNION operator is used to combine the result-set of two or more SELECT statements.
	The columns must also have similar data types (int string?)
		- should be the same field, otherwise it is like mixing data in a column
		
GROUP BY


	SELECT COUNT(CustomerID), Country
	FROM Customers
	GROUP BY Country;
	
	- lists the number of customers in each country:
	- The GROUP BY statement is often used with aggregate functions (COUNT, MAX, MIN, SUM, AVG) 	
HAVING
	SELECT COUNT(CustomerID), Country
	FROM Customers
	GROUP BY Country
	HAVING COUNT(CustomerID) > 5;
	
	-The HAVING clause was added to SQL because the WHERE keyword could not be used with aggregate functions.

STORED PROCEDURES
	CREATE PROCEDURE SelectAllCustomers
	AS
	SELECT * FROM Customers
	GO;	
	(.....later)
	EXEC SelectAllCustomers;
	
	prepared SQL code that you can save, so the code can be reused over and over again.
	
EXISTS

	SELECT SupplierName
	FROM Suppliers
	WHERE EXISTS (SELECT ProductName FROM Products WHERE Products.SupplierID = Suppliers.supplierID AND Price < 20);
	
	Returns TRUE and lists the suppliers with a product price<20
	ie, it returns the single colum table of "SELECT SupplierName FROM Suppliers"
	
	
	- The EXISTS operator returns true if the subquery returns one or more records.
	- is used to test for the existence of any record in a subquery.
	
ANY and ALL
	- like EXISTS but after WHERE and HAVING clauses
	- returns TRUE and the first query if the subquery exists (Usually a condition (ProductsSold>10))
	
MIN / MAX
	SELECT MIN(column_name)
	FROM table_name
	WHERE condition;
	
COUNT(), SUM(), AVG()	
	SELECT SUM(column_name)
	FROM table_name
	WHERE condition;
	
	(...returns this table)
	COUNT(ProductID)
	77
	
IN
	SELECT column_name(s)
	FROM table_name
	WHERE column_name IN (value1, value2, ...);

	The IN operator is a shorthand for multiple OR conditions.
	
BETWEEN
	WHERE column_name BETWEEN value1 AND value2;
	
UPDATE	
	UPDATE Customers
	SET ContactName = 'Alfred Schmidt', City= 'Frankfurt'
	WHERE CustomerID = 1;

DISTINCT
	SELECT DISTINCT column1, column2, ...
	FROM table_name;	

AND / OR
	WHERE condition1 AND condition2 AND condition3 ...;
	
INSERT
	INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, column3, ...)
	VALUES (value1, value2, value3, ...);	
	
NORMALIZATION
	- Database normalization is typically a refinement process after the initial exercise of identifying 
the data objects that should be in the relational database, identifying their relationships and defining 
the tables required and the columns within each table.
	- Normalization entails organizing the columns (attributes) and tables (relations) of a database to 
ensure that their dependencies (logical constraints, FK, PK) are properly enforced by database integrity 
constraints

DENORMALIZTION
	- is intended to speed query execution (reading faster, at the cost of write speed)
	- is used on a previously-normalized 
	
STAR SCHEMA
	- The Star schema is easy to understand and provides optimal disk usage.
	- The star schema consists of one or more fact tables referencing any number of dimension tables. 
	- facts are FKs referencing dimension tables
	- The dimension table contain the set of attributes. (date, product, or customer)
	- The dimension table is joined to the fact table using a foreign key
	- The dimension table are not joined to each other
	- The dimension tables are NOT normalized. 
	
	
	
SNOWFLAKE SCHEMA
	- A Snowflake Schema is an extension of a Star Schema, and it adds additional dimensions
	- fact table in the middle
	- The dimension tables are normalized which splits data into additional tables.
	- The main benefit of the snowflake schema it uses smaller disk space.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------



every one function sould have one entrance and one exit

command-query specation; every method should be either a command or a query, not both. The answer 
to a question should not change the answer

method should do 1 thing (but erroneously it does multiple things)

passing boolean into function is bad

high level methods should do high level work and not low level work

bean are classes that encapsulate many objects into a single object (thebean)

'==' tests object reference in java

 DLL is a library that contains code and data that can be used by more than one program at the same time
 
 public is visible from wherever.

internal is visible only within an assembly

assembly is a file that is automatically generated by the compiler upon successful compilation of every .NET 
application. It can be either a Dynamic Link Library or an executable file.
